Brief description of submitted files:

 src/cellularData/Country.java
     - Class Country stores the name of the country and pass the country name and
     - subscriptions to class SubscriptionYear for storing and sorting data proposes

 src/cellularData/CSVReader.java
 	- Constructs class CSVReader scans data form CSV files
 	- uses data to form different kinds of arrays
  	- returns these arrays to main class

 src/cellularData/DataModelCD
   - Provides access to CSV data

 src/cellularData/LinkedList.java
 	- Creates a generic LinkedList class to implement the generic Iterable interface

 src/cellularData/Node.java
 	- Create a java generic class Node and generate a linked list of that type of object

 src/cellularData/SubscriptionYear.java
 	- Creates SubscriptionYear class that stores single subscription of a specific year

 src/lifeExpectancyAtBirth/Country.java
     - Class Country stores the name of the country and pass the country name and
     - expectancies to class ExpectancyYear for storing and sorting data proposes

 src/lifeExpectancyAtBirth/CSVReader.java

 src/view/ChartGraph.java
   - Creates a model of the data
   - Uses the model to instantiate an object of type javafx.scene.chart.LineChart
   - via the GraphView class
   - Sets up the scene with basic modification to the stage

 src/view/CountrySelector.java
   - Randomly Selects countries for the cellular data graph
   
 src/view/CountrySelector2.java
   - Randomly Selects countries for the Life expectancy graph

 src/view/GraphView.java
   - Creates a data series for each Country object in the cellular data graph

 src/view/GraphView2.java
   - Creates a data series for each Country object in the Life expectancy graph

 resources/cellular.csv
    - A CSV (Comma Separated Value) file.
    - Manage the subscription data over many years for different countries.

 resources/cellular_short_oneDecade.csv
    - A CSV (Comma Separated Value) file.
    - A section of resources/cellular.csv only contains data of three countries in one decade.

 resources/lifeExpectancyAtBirth.csv
    - A CSV (Comma Separated Value) file.
    - Manage the life expectancy at birth data over many years for different countries.
